# Ambulance-Alert-Notifier
Traffic congestion is a huge problem in India and it’s getting worse day by day. And Even though there are traditional methods like Flashing lights and sirens they prove less effective here because there is no space for the other vehicles to make a way at that instant of time as the Sound of the Siren will not leave enough time to properly react to the Approaching Ambulance. Thus we have proposed a system that overcomes the limitations of traditional sirens. In this system, we are using the Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication. This V2X Technology can be used in such a way that the Vehicle communicates with surrounding devices The proposed V2XAANS(Vehicle to Everything Ambulance Alert Notifier system) is a promising solution to improve the response time of emergency services by notifying nearby vehicles of an ambulance’s presence in emergency situations where there is limited space to move forward. By using V2X technology and wireless communication, this system can send alert signals to vehicles that are in the path of the ambulance, and also to the traffic authority which can help to ensure that other drivers are aware of the emergency and can move out of the way to allow the ambulance to pass safely and quickly.
